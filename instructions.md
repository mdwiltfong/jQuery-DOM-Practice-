# Instructions

1. When the DOM is ready, console.log the message “Let’s get ready to party with jQuery!” [x]

1. Set the font size of the title to be a random pixel size from 0 to 100.[x]
1. Add an item to the list; it can say whatever you want.[x]

1. When you change the numbers in the three inputs on the bottom, the background color of the body should change to match whatever the three values in the inputs are.[x]
1. Add an event listener so that when you click on the image, it is removed from the DOM.
